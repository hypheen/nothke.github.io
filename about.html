	Ivan is a game developer from Belgrade, Serbia. He does a lot of game experiments, small games and jams. He is always looking out to try as many new things and ideas as possible and collaborate if he can, but currently he is mostly making games with procedural generation and first person experiences. With a background in architecture and photography, he ventured into game development relatively recently, just 3 years ago. As such he is a jack of all trades jumping from a project to project.
